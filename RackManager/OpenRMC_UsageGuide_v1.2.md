# Scope

This document references requirements and provide the usage examples for the OpenRMC northbound API v1.2.0 for a rack management controller.

# Requirements

As a Redfish-based interface, the required Redfish interface model elements are specified in a profile document. The profile is located at –

<https://github.com/opencomputeproject/OCP-Profiles/blob/master/OCPRackManagerController.v1_2_0_WIP.json>

The OCPRackManagerController.v1.2.0 profile extends from the OCPBaselineHardwareManagement.v1.0.1 profile. The profile is located at –

<https://github.com/opencomputeproject/OCP-Profiles/blob/master/OCPBaselineHardwareManagement.v1_0_1.json>

A profile is read by the Redfish Interop Validator which autogenerates and executes the tests against an implementation.  The Interop Validator generates a test report – in text or HTML format.

  \$\> python3 RedfishInteropValidator.py profileName --ip host:port

The Interop Validator is open source - located at
<https://github.com/DMTF/Redfish-Interop-Validator>.

## Group Operations in Redfish

Group operations are performed using the AggregationService resource.
Actions can be performed on temporary groups or persistent groups.
A temporary group is passed within the action.
A persistent group is create prior to action and referenced within the action.
A persistent group is modelled as an Aggregate resource.
The AggregateService resource contains the Aggregates collection resource whose members are Aggregate resources.

The following command

    **GET** /redfish/v1/AggregationService

The response contains the following fragment. The fragment shows the URI for the Aggregate collection resource.

The fragment shows two actions that can be perform on an aggregate, either temporary or persistent.
The action is invoke by performing a POST to the URI contained in Target property.
The contents of the request body in desribed in resource whose URI is contained in the @Redfish.ActionInfo property.

```
    {
        "@odata.id": "/redfish/v1/AggregationService",
        "Id": "AggregationService",
        "ServiceEnabled": true,
        "Status": {
            "Health": "OK",
            "State: "Enabled"
        },
        "Aggregates": {
            "@odata.id": "/redfish/v1/AggregationService/Aggregates"
        },
        "Actions": {
            "#AggregationService.Reset": {
                "target": "/redfish/v1/AggregationService/Actions/AggregationService.Reset",
                "@Redfish.ActionInfo": "/redfish/v1/AggregationService/ResetActionInfo"
            },
            "#AggregationService.SetDefaultBootOrder": {
                "target": "/redfish/v1/AggregationService/Actions/AggregationService.SetDefaultBootOrder",
                "@Redfish.ActionInfo": "/redfish/v1/AggregationService/SetDefaultBootOrderActionInfo"
            }
        }
    }
```

## Update Firmware

The firmware can be updated with a pull or push method. The "Redfish Firmware Update Whitepaper"\[3\] has detail discussion of the firmware update process.

The main process is for the firmware package to be delivered opaquely, and the Redfish Service interprets the firmware package to determine the components that are updated.
The Targets property can be used to guide and constrain this behavior.

# Use Cases

This section describes how each capability is accomplished by
interacting via the Redfish Interface.

# Security

## Security Model

The security model leverages the authentication, and a flow to ensure
every entity (node, rack manager, CSP) has a certificate.
Pushing/update certificate could follow the CSP or silicon vendor’s
existing flow to obtain/update the certificate. The model is RBAC
security model, in which the CSP is the most privilege entity in the
chain (generate token for both rack manager and nodes and distributes.
CSP also sets up manifest and sends it to rack manager. Rack manager
is the second in hierarchy who has CSPs’ manifest and tokens of all
managed nodes. The least privilege entity in the chain is node which
only possess its own token.

### The necessity for tokens and manifests 

Token is the proof of ownership of a node or rack manager by a CSPs
and shows which entities on rack belongs to which CSP.  Manifest is
the list of nodes from a particular CSP that a specific rack manager
should manage. Tokens are always encrypted in transit that rogue rack
manager could not manage nodes that are not designated to them.

### Attestation

The authentication flow beyond the possession of a certificate as
shown in discovery flow (6.6.1). In the discovery flow, both node and
node manager will authenticate each other’s token which is different
than the certificate.

## Process for authorization between rack manager and managed node

This section specifies the process by which the rack manager verifies
that a managed node is one it is authorized to manage, and for a
managed node to verify that a rack manager is authorized the manage
it.

## Definitions

- **Certificate** = X.509 Certificate (All entities, node, rack manager
  and CSP)

- **Node Certificate** = Certificate issued by a CA for a node

- **Rack Manager Certificate** = Certificate issued by a CA for a rack
  manager

- **Node Token** = CSP certificate + Node Certificate signed by a CSP.

  - The node token is created and distribute during initial setup by CSP
    and shows that the managed node belongs to a CSP.

- **Rack Manager Token** = CSP certificate + rack manager certificate
  signed by a CSP.

  - The rack manager token is created and distribute during initial
    setup by CSP and shows that the rack manager belongs to a CSP.

- **Manageability Manifest =** CSP certificate + All Managed Nodes
  Token.

  - The manifest lists the nodes on the rack that the rack manager can
    manage.

  - The manifest is signed b the CSP

  - Each managed node entry shall contain a node token.

- **Managed Node List =** Node Certificate + Time Stamp of Initial
  session establishment

> In the Redfish Certificate Management Whitepaper \[1\], the node
> certificate and rack manager certificate are referred to as device
> identity certificates.

## Theory of Operations

The rack manager is provided a manageability manifest which includes a list of nodes that it can managed.

As the rack manager discovers a node, it obtains the node's certificate and verifies whether the manageability manifest contains the node. 
If so, it proceeds to proof to the node, that it has authority to manage the node and challenges to node.

## Procedure

### Initial conditions 

- Initial conditions of node
  - Each managed node shall have a node certificate
  - Each managed node shall have a node token.
- Initial conditions of rack manager
  - The rack manager shall have a rack manager certificate
  - The rack manager shall have a rack manager token
  - The rack manager shall have a manageability manifest

### Node Discovery

The following procedure is followed when the rack manager first
discovers the presence of a node.

The rack manager discovers the presence of the node on its rack and asks
for nodes’ certificate. During discovery process, the rack manager knows
nothing about the managed nodes. It could broadcast a message or ping to
get node’s certificate.

The rack manager shall attempt to locate the entry for the node in
manifest.

If the entry is found, the rack manager shall send part of this manifest
and random generated challenge (\[rack manager token + node token +
challenge\] encrypted by node’s public key) to the node.

If the entry is not found, the rack manager shall remain silent

### Node Authentication

The managed node shall decrypt the message with its own private key. It
verifies the signature of its own token and rack manager token. This
authentication indicates that the node manager is the legitimated rack
manager assigned by CSP for this node.

If the authentication is successful, the managed node shall send the
random generated challenge encrypted by rack manager’s public key and
nuance/time to the rack manager.

If the authentication is unsuccessful, the managed node shall remain
silent

The rack manager shall decrypt and verify the challenge and check the
freshness of nuance/time. This indicates that the managed node is the
node that the rack manager has been configured to manage.

Both rack manager and managed node shall generate session keys based on
the challenge and nuance/time to establish a connection.

Rack manager shall retain the node certificate and time stamp at which
the connection was established.

### Certificate Revocation Management

From Rack manager’s perspective, CSP would be in charge of revocation
of a node, and they would update the manifest and pass it to Rack
manager to inform it about the revocation status. Rack manager follows
Update/Revoke flow in 6.6.2 to terminate session for any revoked
nodes.

## Threat and Risk Model

###  Assets

Node's Token = CSP cert + Node's cert signed by CSP
Rack Manager's Token = CSP cert + Rack Manager cert signed by CSP
Manifest = CSP cert + All managed node’s tokens

| **Number** | **Asset**                            | **Pri/Sec** | **Risk** |
| :---       | :-----------                         | :---      	| :----    |
| 1          | Node's Token & Rack Manager Token    | Primary     | High     | 
| 2          | CSP's Manifest                       | Primary     | High     |
| 3          | End user's data or rack resource     | Secondary   | High     |

Reason for Classification
1. This token shows that a node belong to a certain CSP. It is a confidential info to preserve CSP’s inventory privacy and to mitigate malicious attacks (more in thread model). Token are always encrypted in transit.
2. Manifest contains all the nodes that should be managed by a rack manager. All tokens are encrypted by rack manager’s public key to preserve confidentiality and privacy of tokens and mitigate malicious attacks (more in thread model).
3. In transit and storage

### Threats

| \# | Threat | Adversary | Asset | Rank | Mitigation |
|:--:|----|----|:--:|:--:|----|
| 1 | Attacker intercepts network traffic to gain access to CSP’s manifest to add rogue node/rack manager or to discover CSP’s nodes list for targeted attack | Network Adversary | Manifest | H | CSP’s manifest has list of nodes’ token encrypted by designated rack manager’s public key |
| 2 | Attacker set up a rogue node/rack manager to access specific CSP’s nodes | Network Adversary | End User’s Data | H | Nodes and rack managers for a particular CSP have a token (CSP’s certificate + Node/Rack Manager certificate signed by CSP). Rogue node’s and rogue rack manager’s attempt fails during discover phase without valid token. |
| 3 | Attacker sniffs the traffic during CSP’s initial token distribution to access legitimate node/rack manager token to set up a rogue node/rack manager with reply attack | Network Adversary | Node/ Rack Manager Token | H | Node/rack manager’s token are always encrypted during transition with node/rack manager’s public key. |
| 4 | Rogue node attempts to get added to a CSP’s rack manager | Network Adversary | End User’s Data | H | During discovery phase, rack manager checks if node’s certificate is part of CSP’s manifest. If not, it logs a “Unrecognized Node on Rack” event in its log (no session will establish). |
| 5 | Rogue node attempts to reply a legitimate node certificate | Network Adversary | End User’s Data | H | During discovery phase, rack manager will send a challenge encrypted by legitimate node’s public key. Node should resend back the challenge encrypted by rack manager’s public key. If rack manager could not verify the exact challenge sent, it records a “Suspicious Node on Rack” event in its log (no session will get established) |
| 6 | Revoked node continues to use resource of the rack | Network Adversary | Rack Resources | H | After revocation, CSP sends an updated manifest to rack manager. rack manager terminates the session of revoked nodes during updated manifest flow. It records “Revoked Node” event in its log. |
| 7 | Rogue rack manager attempts to manage CSP’s nodes | Network Adversary | End User’s Data | H | In discovery flow, rack manager send its token to managed node. Node verifies rack manager’s token signature to make sure rack manager belongs to the same CSPs as itself . If it does not, it logs “Suspicious Rack manager” in its log. (no session will get established). |
| 8 | Non designated rack manager (belong to the same CSP as the node) attempts to manage nodes | Network Adversary | End User’s Data | H | In discovery flow, rack manager sends node’s token from its manifest as a proof that this rack manager is the designated rack manager for that node. Node verifies the node token to make sure rack manager is its designated rack manager. |
|  |  |  |  |  | Other node managers do not have node’s token (encrypted during transit) |
| 9 | A rogue rack manager attempts to reply legitimate encrypted rack manager’s token | Network Adversary | End User’s Data | H | In discovery flow, node decrypts rack manager’s token and checks the cert in token with the cert that rogue rack manager passes down early in discovery flow. Discrepancy leads to the fact that node logs “Suspicious Node Manger” event (no session will get establish). |
